# Clothing Mag (Richiesoft)
Clothing App [Win11 version]

# Overview

I wanted to share all my works for more than six years of Studio startup & personal project for public usage. I am the founder of Richiesoft Studio where I build enormous app covering consumer, media & ad verticals. This project is one of the repo I had personally stored.

This volume of the magazine marks its advent to the market and gives much detailed looks into the fashion industry with respect to Clothing. A perfect blend of Styling, Grooming and Health tips are covered up in each edition, with the pinch of technology to enhance the fashion, provided by Glueping Tech Corners. Welcome again to Planet's only magazine meant for Clothing in all aspects.
